```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Here on this page you can upload the PDF files into the Database. Here vector embeddings will be created inserted in the Pincone DB.

Now you can redirect to the chat page - [http://localhost:3000/chat](http://localhost:3000/chat)

Here you can test the bot for answers.

## Bot Loader Embed Link

In the `bot-loader.js` file, put the link of the hosted widget, in the **widgetUrl** variable.

Now Copy the bot-loader.js file and upload on the CDN provider. The link to this file on the cloud will be your embedding link of the chatbot. You can now use this embedding link in any other project to use the chatbot.
